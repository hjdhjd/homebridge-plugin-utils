## Opinionated utilities to provide useful capabilities and create rich configuration webUI experiences for Homebridge plugins.
</DIV>
</SPAN>

`homebridge-plugin-utils` is a utility library for [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io) [plugins](https://developers.homebridge.io) that aims to provide a set of common core capabilities that can accelerate and streamline plugin development. It's opinionated and largely derived from my other plugins and my desire to increase code reuse and make it easier to provide rich capabilities across all my plugins so that each of my plugins can focus on providing their unique capabilities rather than copying over the same capabilities (feature options, MQTT support, and a rich webUI interface to name a few) time after time.

The design decisions are driven by my own needs as I continue to create, evolve, and maintain my plugins but I also wanted to provide these as a resource to others, should it be of interest.
